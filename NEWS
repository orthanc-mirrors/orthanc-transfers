Pending changes in the mainline
===============================

Minimum plugin SDK (for build): 1.12.1
Minimum Orthanc runtime: 1.12.1

* For "Push" jobs, if the initial response from the remote peer contains a cookie, this
  cookie is copied in all subsequent requests to the same peer for this push job: 
    Some load balancers such as AWS Application Load Balancer use Sticky
    Session Cookies, which are set by the load balancer on a request. If
    subsequent requests include these cookies, then the load balancer will
    route the request to the same backend server.
* now setting "Content-Type" HTTP headers in outgoing POST requests.
  (https://discourse.orthanc-server.org/t/transfer-accelerator-plugin-http-header-compatibility/5725)
* new "PeerCommitTimeout" configuration to configure the HTTP Timeout when committing
  a push transfer.  During that time, the remote peer plugin must import all files into Orthanc
  which can take a significant time if the transfer is large.  The default value is
  set to 600 seconds.
* Maintenance: Use Orthanc SDK 1.12.4 by default to benefit from more detailed logging.


Version 1.5 (2024-03-26)
========================

Minimum plugin SDK (for build): 1.12.1
Minimum Orthanc runtime: 1.12.1

* No functional changes !
* updated to Orthanc Framework 1.12.1


Version 1.4 (2023-02-06)
========================

=> Recommaneded SDK version: 1.11.2 <=
=> Minimum SDK version: 1.5.0 <=

* updated to Orthanc Framework and to SDK 1.11.3: improved HTTP Client logs + avoid possible
  crash in Job GetContent.
* new "PeerConnectivityTimeout" configuration to configure the HTTP Timeout when checking
  if a remote peer has the transfer plugin enabled in /transfers/peers GET route.
  Default value is 2 which was the hardcoded default value in previous versions.

Version 1.3 (2022-11-30)
========================

* new "SenderTransferID" option when creating a transfer.  This id is added as an HTTP Header
  ("sender-transfer-id") in every outgoing request that relates to this transfer and can be used 
  e.g, by a load balancer to route all requests from a single transfer to the same Orthanc.
  If no "SenderTransferID" is provided, a UUID is generated by the plugin.  
  This header is only used in PushMode.
  Note that, when generated by the plugin, the "sender-transfer-id" is NOT the job id (the job id
  does not exist yet at this time) and is NOT the transaction id that is actually generated on the
  receiver side.

Version 1.2 (2022-07-12)
========================

=> Minimum SDK version: 1.5.0 <=

* improved error reporting
* fixed transfer error occuring when the resources to transfer did not fit inside the
  plugin cache (512 MB by default).  The error generated high CPU usage on the sending side
  while compressing large files instead of a simple bucket and in NetworkProtocolError
  on the receiving side.

Version 1.1 (2022-06-22)
========================

* Added "Resources" and "Originator" in the jobs "Content".  "Resources"
  is copied directly from the query that created the job.
* Support of dynamic linking against the system-wide Orthanc framework library


Version 1.0 (2019-03-04)
========================

* Initial release


2018-09-17
==========

* Initial publication of the source code
